# Lending club case study
> Problem Statement:
- If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
- If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.
- The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind the loan default. i.e the variables which are strong in loan default.

## General Information
- Done the case study as individual.
- Had an handfull of data insight using EDA (Uni and Bi variat) analysis.


## Conclusions
- 1. Will consider the salary based on the house type

    - MORTGAGE greater 80000
    - OWN greater 50000
    - RENT greater then 50000

- 2. Based on the above comparison 

    - Found that People with any grade and annual salary between `('400000-500000')` and employment of `9 years` are good to provide loan they generally pay loan properly

    - Note : Should be careful with people on grade D

- 3. High term of tenure is helping people to repayment of any salary group

- 4. Employee above 10+ years of experiance are defaulters most probebly
